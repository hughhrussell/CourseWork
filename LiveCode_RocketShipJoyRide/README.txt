RocketShip JoyRide
Author: Hugh Russell

Game Mode(s)
Single player is the only supported game mode. The main activity is 
controlling a rocket and recovering escape pods while avoiding obstacles 
– mines, asteroids and space junk. The player will also capture fuel. 
The player generates points each time they rescue a pod or gather a fuel 
boost. Every 5000 points, the player is rewarded with an extra life to a 
maximum of 3 at any time. The player’s game will end if either they run 
out of fuel or lives or the countdown clock reaches zero on the last level.
 The goal is to survive to the end of the game play while acquiring as many 
pods and fuels cells as possible (each generates points). Lives will also 
be cashed in for points at the game’s end.

Storyline
The player assumes the role of a character that has taken a rocket ship for 
a joy ride in order to save his friends from dying in space. The character’s 
friends are floating in space in life pods which the player must reach in 
order to rescue. Each time a pod is rescued, the pilot is given a reward 
(points in score board). The pilot must avoid obstacles floating through 
space and he/she will need to collect fuel cells in order to keep their rocket
 ship alive. As the game progresses, the section of outer space becomes more 
hazardous - the space obstacles become more hazardous (quicker and in more 
quantity). If they run out of fuel or lives, the game is over. The obstacles 
floating in space are asteroids, debris from ships, satellites and mines.

Gameplay (in draft)
The app opens to a main screen with Play, About, and Instructions button options. 
Once the Play button is selected the game screen is rendered with a random pattern
 of stars and a predetermined location and direction of the rocket ship.

Objective. The player’s objective is to navigate the rocket ship retrieving as many
 pods and fuel cells as possible before the game ends. Running out of fuel cells, 
time or lives (due to collisions with objects) ends the game. Points are gained by 
retrieving life pods and fuel cells. If the player survives all levels, he/she is 
rewarded for unused lives. 

Achievements. Points are achieved each time a pod (1000 points) or fuel cell 
(500 points) are collected. It is the player’s goal to collect as many as possible. 
The player is also rewarded for the number of lives he has remaining when a level 
is over (5000 points each). During gameplay, the acquisition of 5000 points grants 
the player an extra life bonus.
